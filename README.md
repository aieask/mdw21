# Memory Design Workshop 2021
<img src = "media/poster.jpg">
This repository reflects the work done in the lab sessions the Memory Design Workshop 2021 (MDW), offered by IEEE Banglore Section and IEEE CAS Banglore Chapter. The event was comprised of 5 days of lectures,2 in a day from Industry maestros and esteemed academicians, followed by self-paced hands-on lab session spanning over 2 weeks, aiming to familiarise ourselves with freeware tools, PDKs, Analog Design focusing on Memory Designs and Concepts.

## About
This workshop presents a basic overview of different SRAM Cell Designs using [LTSpice](https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/design-tools-and-calculators/ltspice-simulator.html) and ASU's [Arizona State Predictive PDK (ASAP)](https://asap.asu.edu/) 14nm FinFET node, using an intuitive approach to designing a simple SRAM Cells. This workshop also provides deep insights into recent advancements and current research trends in Memory Cell Designs. Here I have uploaded all the works done by me in 4 lab sessions organized by this workshop.
